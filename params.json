{"tagline":"The easy to use, open source Python IRC Bot (a fork of SkyBot - formerly known as lukeroge/CloudBot)","google":"","name":"Cloudbot","body":"# CloudBot\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nCloudBot is a Python IRC bot very heavily based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot) by [rmmh](http://git.io/rmmh).  \r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\n* Easy to use wrapper\r\n* Intuitive configuration\r\n* Fully controlled from IRC\r\n* Fully compatable with existing skybot plugins\r\n* Easily extendable\r\n  * Thorough documentation\r\n  * Cross-platform\r\n* Muti-threaded, efficient\r\n  * Automatic reloading\r\n  * Little boilerplate\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nGet CloudBot at [git.io/getcloudbotirc](http://git.io/getcloudbotirc \"Get CloudBot from Github!\").\r\n\r\nUnzip the resulting file, and continue to read this document.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nBefore you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python modules. These are `lXML` and `BeautifulSoup`.  These can be installed with PIP (The Python package manager):\r\n\r\n`sudo pip install lxml`\r\n\r\n`sudo pip install beautifulsoup`\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Debian based systems, you can get pip with\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install pip`\r\n\r\nFor `.spell` to work, we also need a library called `Enchant`.  On Debian based systems, install it with:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install python-enchant`\r\n\r\nIn addition, for `.whois` to work optimally, you must have `whois` installed. Again, on Debian based systems, install it with:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install whois`\r\n\r\nFor the wrapper to work best, install `screen`, or `daemon`:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install screen`\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install daemon`\r\n\r\nIf you are a user of another Linux disto, use your package manager to install the dependencies, or, for other operating systems,  use **Google** to locate source packages you can install.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies, run the bot¹:\r\n\r\n`./cloudbot start`\r\n\r\nIt will generate a default config for you.  Once you have edited the config, run it again with:\r\n\r\n`./cloudbot start`\r\n\r\nand it will connect to any server(s) you have added to the config. (Config docs at the [wiki](http://git.io/cloudbotircconfig))\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nTo configure your CloudBot, visit the [Config Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircconfig).\r\n\r\nTo write your own plugins, visit the [Plugin Wiki Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircplugins).\r\n\r\nMore at the [Wiki Main Page](http://git.io/cloudbotircwiki).\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nThe developers reside in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot) on [EsperNet](http://esper.net) and would be glad to help you.\r\n\r\nIf you think you have found a bug/have a idea/suggestion, please **open a issue** here on Github.\r\n\r\n## Example CloudBots\r\n\r\nThe developers of CloudBot run two CloudBots on [Espernet](http://esper.net).\r\n\r\nThey can both be found in [#CloudBot](irc://irc.esper.net/cloudbot \"Connect via IRC to #CloudBot on irc.esper.net).\r\n\r\n**mau5bot** is the stable bot, and runs on the latest release version of CloudBot. (mau5bot is running on **Ubuntu Server** *Oneric Ocelot/11.10* with **Python** *2.7.2*)\r\n\r\n**neerbot** is the unstable bot, and runs on the latest development² version of CloudBot. (neerbot is running on **Debian** *Wheezy/Testing* with **Python** *2.7.2*)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nCloudBot runs on **Python** *2.7.x*. It is developed on **Debian** *Wheezy/Testing* and **Ubuntu** *11.10* with **Python** *2.7.2*.\r\n\r\nIt **requires Python modules** `lXML`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Enchant`, `psutil`, and `HTTPlib2`.\r\n\r\nThe programs `screen` or `daemon` are recomended for the wrapper to run optimaly.\r\n\r\n**Windows** users: Windows compatibility with the wrapper and some plugins is **broken** (such as the ping), but we do intend to add it.³\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCloudBot is **licensed** under the **GPL v3** license.
